## [2.0.0] - 2026-02-06

### ✨ Highlights

**Veritas Kanban 2.0 is the multi-agent release.** 18 features shipped across agent orchestration, dashboard analytics, lifecycle automation, and developer experience. This release transforms VK from a single-agent task board into a full multi-agent orchestration platform.

### Added

#### Multi-Agent System (#28, #29, #30, #31)

- **Agent Registry** (#52) — Service discovery with heartbeat tracking, capabilities, live status, REST API for register/deregister/heartbeat/stats
- **Multi-Agent Dashboard Sidebar** (#28) — Real-time agent status cards in board sidebar, expandable details, color-coded status indicators (green=working, purple=sub-agent, gray=idle, red=error)
- **Multi-Agent Task Assignment** (#29) — Assign multiple agents to a single task, color-coded agent chips in task detail and board cards, shared helper utilities
- **@Mention Notifications** (#30) — @agent-name parsing in comments, thread subscriptions, delivery tracking, notification bell
- **Agent Permission Levels** (#31) — Intern / Specialist / Lead tiers with configurable approval workflows and autonomy boundaries

#### Dashboard Analytics (#57, #58, #59, #60, #61)

- **Where Time Went** (#57) — Time breakdown by project via telemetry data with color-coded project bars
- **Activity Clock** (#58) — 24-hour donut chart showing agent work distribution, sourced from status-history transitions
- **Hourly Activity Chart** (#59) — Bar chart with per-hour event counts, sourced from status-history
- **Wall Time Toggle** (#60) — Total Agent Time + Avg Run Duration with explanatory tooltips
- **Session Metrics** (#61) — Session count, success rate, completed/failed/abandoned tracking

#### Lifecycle & Automation

- **Task Lifecycle Hooks** (#72) — 7 built-in hooks (subtask-gate, assignee-required, blocked-reason, done-checklist, auto-archive, time-tracking, notification), 8 lifecycle events, custom hooks API
- **Documentation Freshness** (#74) — Steward workflow with freshness headers (`fresh-days`, `owner`, `last-verified`), 3-phase automation plan
- **Error Learning Workflow** (#91) — Structured failure analysis, similarity search for recurring issues, stats API. Inspired by @nateherk's Klouse dashboard concept.

#### Developer Experience

- **Markdown Rendering** (#63) — MarkdownText component for rich text in task descriptions and comments
- **Cost Prediction** (#54) — Multi-factor cost estimation model (tokens, compute, overhead) for task budgeting
- **CLI Usage Reporting** (#50) — `vk usage` command for token and cost reporting from the terminal
- **Dashboard Widget Toggles** (#92) — Show/hide individual dashboard widgets with settings gear and localStorage persistence
- **Production Binding** (#55) — `VK_HOST` and `VK_PORT` environment variables for flexible deployment

### Changed

- **Timezone-aware metrics** — Server reports its timezone dynamically in all API response `meta`; clients can request metrics in their local timezone via `?tz=<offset>` query parameter
- **Activity data source** — Activity Clock and Hourly Activity Chart now pull from `status-history` (reliable state transitions) instead of `activity.json`
- **Cost-per-task clickability** — Enhanced hover states, border effects, and arrow indicator
- **Archive optimistic updates** — Archive mutations now remove tasks from cache immediately via `onMutate`, with rollback on error
- **Agent naming convention** — Agent names use ALL CAPS for acronyms (VERITAS, TARS, CASE, K-2SO, R2-D2, MAX)

### Fixed

- **Daily Activity 100% bug** — Utilization was calculated using UTC dates but displayed in local timezone, causing incorrect percentages
- **Feb 3 telemetry outlier** — 66-minute run normalized to 19min (p95 level)
- **Feb 2 telemetry outliers** — 3 runs (15-19min range) normalized to 10min
- **Registry stats interface mismatch** — Frontend expected `totalAgents`/`onlineAgents` but server sent `total`/`online`; interface updated to match server

### Security

- **MCP SDK vulnerability patched** — Updated `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` from 1.25.3 to ^1.26.0 (GHSA-345p-7cg4-v4c7, cross-client data leak)
- **Rate limiting documented** — README now warns that VK does not include built-in rate limiting; reverse proxy recommended for public deployments

### Maintenance

- **21 stale feature branches cleaned** — Down to `main` only
- **README roadmap updated** — Reflects v2.0 shipped features, v1.6.0 and earlier history preserved
- **Version bumped** across all packages (root, server, web, shared, mcp)

### Credits

- [@nateherk](https://github.com/nateherk) — Error learning workflow inspired by Klouse dashboard concept
- [@mvoutov](https://github.com/mvoutov) — Documentation freshness inspired by BoardKit Orchestrator

#### Fixes

##### GH-86: Bulk Archive Silent Failure (#86)

**Root Cause:** `BulkActionsBar.handleArchiveSelected()` used `Promise.all()` with no error handling. When any single archive failed, the entire batch would silently reject with zero user feedback.

**Fix:**

- Import `useToast` hook
- Replace `Promise.all()` with per-task error tracking loop
- Show success toast (e.g., "Archived 5 tasks")
- Show error toast on partial/full failure with counts
- Log individual failures to console for debugging
- Clear selection regardless of outcome
- **File:** `web/src/components/board/BulkActionsBar.tsx` (+38 lines)

##### GH-87: Sidebar Task Counts Out of Sync (#87)

**Root Cause:** The sidebar uses `useMetrics('24h')` which polls every 30 seconds with 10-second staleTime. Meanwhile, `useUpdateTask` mutations did NOT invalidate the metrics cache, causing up to 30 seconds of stale data after status changes.

**Fix:**

- Add metrics query invalidation to `useUpdateTask.onSuccess()`
- Only invalidate when task status changes (prevents over-invalidation)
- Preserves timer state handling (no aggressive blanket invalidation)
- **File:** `web/src/hooks/useTasks.ts` (+9 lines)

### Scripts

- **scripts/dev-clean.sh** — Added explicit `pnpm` path resolution for launchd sessions (fixes "command not found" in automated restarts)
- **scripts/dev-watchdog.sh** — Improved restart storm prevention with lock file + PID checking; fixed pnpm path resolution

### CLI

- **`vk setup`** — New guided onboarding wizard that validates environment and helps new users get started:
  - Checks Node version (requires ≥18)
  - Verifies server is running and reachable
  - Tests API authentication
  - Optionally creates a welcome task with next steps
  - Supports `--json` output for automation and `--skip-task` to skip sample task
  - Credit: BoardKit Orchestrator (Monika Voutov) for the wizard pattern inspiration

### Fixed

- **Archive/Delete/Restore** — Fixed "Archive failed" errors caused by filename mismatch when task titles changed after creation. Now uses `findTaskFile()` to locate actual file on disk by task ID prefix instead of computing filename from current title
- **Sidebar Task Counts** — Fixed metrics showing time-filtered counts (e.g., 33 todo) instead of current board state (e.g., 124 todo). `/api/metrics/all` now returns current task status counts regardless of period filter; period only applies to telemetry metrics (runs, tokens, duration)
- **Backlog Count API** — Fixed double-wrapped response (`{data: {success, data: {count}}}`) by letting `responseEnvelopeMiddleware` handle wrapping

### Security

- **SEC-001 Extended** — Added path traversal validation to `trace-service.ts` (attemptId, taskId, traceId) and `template-service.ts` (templateId) using `validatePathSegment()` + `ensureWithinBase()`

### Changed

- Version bumped from 1.4.1 → 1.5.0

---

## [1.4.1] - 2026-02-02

### Security

- **SEC-001 Path Traversal Prevention** — added strict path segment validation + base directory enforcement in server utilities; applied to file-based services that join paths from user-controlled ids
- **SEC-007 Admin Authorization** — enforced admin (or admin+agent where appropriate) on mutating settings/config/activity/status-history/notifications endpoints

### Fixed

- **Agent Status Panel** now uses real-time WebSocket updates (`useRealtimeAgentStatus`) and correctly handles `activeAgents` payloads
- Improved proxy/IP trust behavior for rate limiting (`X-Forwarded-For` only trusted when `trust proxy` is configured)

## [1.4.0] - 2026-02-01

### ✨ Highlights

- **CLI Workflow Commands** — Two-command task lifecycle (`vk begin` / `vk done`) plus time tracking, comments, agent status, and project management from the terminal
- Inspired by Boris Cherny's (Claude Code creator) "automate everything you do twice" philosophy

### Added

#### CLI Workflow Commands (#44)

- **Composite workflows** — Complete task lifecycle in single commands:
  - `vk begin <id>` — Sets in-progress + starts timer + updates agent status to working
  - `vk done <id> "summary"` — Stops timer + sets done + adds comment + sets agent idle

- **Agent status CLI** — Manage agent presence:
  - `vk agent status` — Show current agent status
  - `vk agent working <id>` — Set to working (auto-fetches task title)
  - `vk agent idle` — Set to idle
  - `vk agent sub-agent <count>` — Set sub-agent mode with count
- **Project management CLI** — `vk project list` and `vk project create "name"` with `--color` and `--description` flags

- **Chat delete not clearing UI** — React Query kept stale cached data after session file was deleted; now uses `removeQueries` to nuke cache
- **Chat send broken after delete** — Server now recreates task-scoped sessions instead of throwing 404
- **Cross-column drag-and-drop** — Tasks reliably move between columns with local state management during drag
- **Dashboard agent comparison** — Fixed broken data fetch (raw `fetch` → `apiFetch` for envelope unwrapping)
- **Dashboard drill-down** — Removed duplicate X button, fixed focus ring clipping, wired up `open-task` event
- **Localhost auth rate limit** (#25) — Exempted localhost from rate limiting
- **Numeric inputs** — Clean inputs without browser spinners (#19)
- **Timer start/stop** — Optimistic UI toggle + cache patch for instant feedback
- **Task cache fragmentation** — All routes now use TaskService singleton
- **Sprint/Agent label alignment** — Fixed form layout in task detail panel
- **Sticky header** — Fixed positioning + matched indicator dot sizes
- **Keyboard test infinite loop** — Resolved render loop in `useKeyboard` + memoized context
- **Agent idle timeout** — Increased from 5 to 15 minutes to reduce false resets
- **File lock ordering** — Added in-process FIFO queue for deterministic write ordering
- **Search filters** — Added task ID to board and archive search

### Changed

- Agent status popover: moved idle description to bottom, added activity history link
- WebSocket indicator: click popover with connection status explanation
- Dashboard layout: Daily Activity (75%) + Recent Status Changes (25%) side-by-side
- Rolling average line: cyan-teal to contrast purple theme
- Bar chart hover: subtle muted fill instead of white flash
- All repo links updated to BradGroux (primary repo)
- All contact emails standardized to contact@digitalmeld.io
- Test suite: 72 files, **1,270 tests** (up from 61 files / 1,143 tests)
