### Summary

GitHub issues should not be posted as long walls of text; use scannable formatting.

### Details

User feedback: the issue body was "not well formatted" and read like a wall of text.

The correct pattern for VK issues:

- Short summary at top
- Clear sections with headings
- Bullets over paragraphs
- Explicit Scope / Out of scope
- Acceptance Criteria as checkboxes
- Keep key decisions as short callouts

### Suggested Action

- When creating GitHub issues, default to a scannable template:
  - Summary → Why → Current truth → Scope → Out of scope → Acceptance Criteria
- If user requests "well formatted", keep total body length tight and avoid dense prose.

### Metadata

- Source: user_feedback
